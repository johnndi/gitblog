        <h1>everyday git</h1>
        <h2>what is git</h2>
        <p>Git is a version control system.created by linus torvalds.
            A version control system is a software tool that helps to track and manage changes to files, code, documents, and any other types of digital content over time.
            In software engineering, git helps us to keep track of changes to code.
            Git is also used to collaborate in code by several software engineers.

            <h2>installing git</h2>
            <ul>
     <li>Your operating system does not come with git installed by default (especially windows operating system).</li>
     <li>To check if you have git installed in your machine or not:
        <ul>
    <li>Open the command prompt in windows or terminal in linux/macos.
    Type the command <b>git --version.</b>
    Hit enter.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
                <li>If you have git installed, you should see something like: git version x.y<img src="./assets/pic 1.png" alt="message if git is installed" height="240" width=""></li>
                <li>If not, then you will see an error message that the command is not recognized.</li>
                <li>If you don’t have git installed, head over to <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/">https://www.git-scm.com</a>and download git from there.</li>
            
            </ul><br>
            
                
                
                
                 
                <h2>configuring git</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Now, let Git know who you are. This is an important step after installing git as each Git commit uses this information</li>
                    <li>To let git know who you are, you pass in the username and email address.
    To configure your email address: <b>git config –global user.email “your email address”</b><br>
    </li><li><em>Tip: use your github email address or if you don’t have a github account, use an email address that you will use to sign up for github</em></li>
    </ul>

        <h2>initializing git repository</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Before we can use git in our project, we need initialize a git repository inside that project.</li>
            <li> A git repository is a storage location where GIT version control system manages and stores project’s files and revision history.</li>
            <li> Checking if a project contains a git repository already is important to avoid re-initializing a git repository where there is already one which is a bad practice in git.</li>
            <li> To check if the project contains a git repository, run the command <b>git status</b>, if the project does not contain a git repository, you will get the message<b> “fatal not a git repository…”</b> this means that the project does not contain a git repository, any other message means that the project contains a git repository.</li>
    <li>If the project/folder does not contain a git repository, you can initialize/create a repository using the command<b>git init</b> , if a repository is initialized successfully, you will see the text<b>“Initialized an empty git repository in…”</b></li>
        </ul>

            <h2>adding files to the staging area</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A staging environment/staging area/index is an area where changes to files are prepared before they are committed to repository.</li>
    <li>Whenever you hit a milestone, or finish part of the work, you should add the files to a staging environment.</li>
    <li> Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on.</li>
    <li> To add a file to the staging environment, <b>use git add filename.</b></li>
    <li>If you have more than one file, you can specify those files: <b>git add file1 file2 file3</b></li>
    <li>If you want to add all the files in the project, instead of specifying those files, use a period symbol;<b>git add .</b> </li>
    <li>You can also use<b>git add --all</b>  to add all the files.</li>
    <li>  The shortcut for git add –all is <b>git add -A</b></li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./assets/pic 5.png" alt="git add  one file" height="60" width="">
    <img src="./assets/pic 6.png" alt="git add for multiple files" height="60" width="">
    <img src="./assets/pic 8.png" alt="git add . for multiple files" height="60" width=""><br>   
                <h2>committing changes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A commit in git is a snapshot of changes made to a repository at a particular point in time.</li>
                    <li>Adding commits keeps track of our progress and changes as we work.</li>
                    <li>Git considers each commit change point or a save point, it is a point we can go back to in our project if we find a bug or we want to make a change.</li>
                    <li>We use git commit –m “commit message” to commit changes to our repository</li>
                    <li>The commit command performs a commit and the -m “message” adds a message.</li>
                    <li>If we want we can view past commits using the<b>git log</b>  command.</li>
                    <li> We can use <b>git log --one line</b> if we want a bit more compressed output of git log.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="./assets/pic 9.png" alt="committing files" height="120" width="">
                <img src="./assets/pic 10.png" alt="commit log" height="120" width=""><br>
                <h2>branches</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A branch is a new/separate version of the main repository</li>
                    <li> Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.</li>
                    <li>When the work is complete, a branch can be merged into the main project</li>
                    
                </ul><br>
                <h3>creating a branch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To create branch, we use the command <b>git branch new-branch-name</b></li>
                    
                </ul>
                <img src="./assets/pic 11.png" alt="creating a branch" height="120" width=""><br>
                <h3>viewing all branches</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>We can then view all the branches we have using the command <b>git branch</b></li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./assets/pic 12.png" alt="viewing all branches" height="120" width=""><br>
    <h3>switching active branches</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> The branch with a * symbol to its left is the active branch/the branch we are in, we can change branches using the command<b>git checkout branch-name</b></li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./assets/pic 13.png" alt="switching branches" height="120" width="">
    <h3>merging a branch</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Once you finish working in your branch and you are comfortable that is what you want, we merge this branch to the master branch/ the main branch.
            The master/main branch typically contains the latest, stable version of the codebase, it is here where all finished and tested features are integrated.
            To merge a branch, add all the changes made in that branch to the staging area, then commit those changes.
            After that, move to your master/main branch/the branch you want to merge this branch with.
            We then use the command git merge branch-name to merge that branch.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./assets/pic 14.png" alt="merging a branch" height="120" width=""><br>
    <h3>deleting a branch</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> If we want/and are sure, we can then delete that branch using the command git branch –d branch-name</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./assets/pic 15.png" alt="deleting a branch" height="120" width=""><br>
    <h2>github</h2>
    <p>after learning git the next tool one needs to be conversant with is github </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Github is a web based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
        </li>
        <li>Github allows us to host Git repositories on it’s platform, we can store our code on github and collaborate with other developers from all over the world.
        </li>
        <li>You can sign up for a free personal github account at <a href=" https://github.com/"> https://github.com</a>
        </li>
